//"use strict";

//use strict is above this comment, and tells the javascript runtime environment to execute the code strictly. in other words, variables must be defined properly when using it, where otherwise you may be able to get away with defining a variable without 'var'


a = 1; //errors out when using strict mode.
console.log(a);
